This project was created as part of the CodeCore web development bootcamp (January 2018 Cohort). It was completed using a rails API, a react front end, and copius amounts of caffeine.

# Project Overview

This side is designed to act as a training ground for users to hone their coding development skills.

Users can compete quizzes to earn points and badges to work their way up the leaderboard.

# Setup

Start by cloning both repo to your computer:
* Front-side-for-Quirky-Quizzes
* Back-side-for-Quirky-Quizzes

Make sure to setup Back end first, following this link :
https://github.com/erikabalbino/Back-side-for-Quirky-Quizzes

and then follow the steps below to setup the frontend:

## Front end

1. Navigate to the client directory in your terminal and run `$ npm i` to install all necessary modules.
2. In the client directory run `$ npm run start` to run the react client. Default configuration will open the client in your default browser on port 3002.
3. You can now log in as an admin to create, review, update and delete quizzes, with the following credentials:

* email: admin@gmail.com
* password: supersecret

4. You may also create new users via the sign up page, or check the seeded databases for other users to sign in as. By default, all seeded users have the password 'supersecret'
